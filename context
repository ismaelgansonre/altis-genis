Thought for 36s## Plan for AltiGenis Website Refinement

Based on the provided screenshots, I'll refine the geological engineering consulting website with the following approach:

**Structure & Pages:**

1. Home page with hero, sectors overview, values, and team sections
2. About page (À Propos) with company vision and values
3. Sector pages: Mine, Hydraulic Infrastructures, Construction Management, Urban Development, Environment
4. Contact page with form and company details
5. Careers page (Carrière)


**Key Features:**

- Bilingual support (French/English) with toggle button
- AltiGenis branding with logo from provided URL
- Color scheme: Green accent (`#7CB342` style), Navy blue (`#003B5C`), White, Light gray backgrounds
- Fully responsive mobile design
- Animated UI components using shadcn/ui
- Sector-specific imagery and layouts
- Professional, clean design reflecting geological engineering expertise


**Technical Approach:**

- Use Next.js App Router with TypeScript
- Implement i18n for bilingual content
- shadcn/ui components throughout
- Framer Motion for animations
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Reusable components for consistency


**Pages to Build:**

1. Layout with navigation and language toggle
2. Home page with animated hero and sector cards
3. About page
4. Individual sector pages (5 sectors)
5. Contact page with form
6. Careers page


Does this plan align with your vision? Should I proceed with implementation?
